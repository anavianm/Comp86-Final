User Interface Design

First, we have made our design simple and clear. Our main goal or purpose of our project is the speech recognition game, so other designs should be kept simple and limited to bring focus and attention to our game. So, the only features that are placed on the website are the canvas and the control buttons (up, down, etc), as well as the score. The control buttons are placed in proximity to each other, increasing proximity compatibility. Since our game is a speech recognition simple version for the game 'flappybird,' a mobile application that aims to control the bird without hitting the green columns We have utilized familiar icons for coins and the game icon to be flappybird. 
Furthermore, we implemented an 'instructions' page so that the user knows what to say, and hence what phrases will bring upon which actions. This can be accessed through saying 'how to play' or 'instructions.' Not just the action commands, but if the user wants to restart or start a new game, they can even do so through the speech recognition by saying 'restart.' 
There are four commands 'up,' 'down,' 'left,' and 'right' to move the game icon, namely, flappybird to move in those respective directions. However, through user testing, we realised that the speech recognition has difficultly recognizing the word 'up'. Since this word is only a two-letter word and has one syllable, it only takes the user minial time to say this phrase. So, when the user says 'up,' the speech recognition sometimes either thinks that nothing was said (because the word is too short) or it recognizes as a different word such as 'app.' Thus, in order to decrease possible user errors in which the program might recognize a different word, we implemented our code so that it registeres 'go up' and 'above' to bring the same result as saying (and the computer recognizing) 'up.' Furthrermore, even if the user mistakenly says a random phrase, the program would still recognize and display the phrase/word, but will not do anything because we only have specific commands that would result in moving the bird.
